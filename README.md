# 1515PanelClips
 A resized and reworked version of Annex's excellent 2020 panel clips, to work with 1515 based printers. A big tip of the hat to Anlin on these.  I would never have attempted this if the existing clips weren't so well done. The key geometry in particular is clearly the result of many iterations.  They work so well on my v2, I had to have them on my Micron too. 

Check out the originals here.  Your 2020 based enclosed printer will thank you:

Here is a look at the front and rear of the scaled down panel clips for 1515.

To adapt to the smaller size, I had to lose the skeletonized cutouts, and adjust the keyhole geometry.  The key and it's many refinements are nearly unchanged.  I simply cut it into pieces and resized the bits to suit my scaling, then smooshed it back together.  It is more slight than the 2020 key, but the geometry still seems to work, and the retention and 90 degree turn locking work as intended.  The two lock bodies were reworked slightly in shape to better suit diminutive 1515 printers.  I stylized the keyhole a little to suit my own taste.  It works and prints ok, but may get walked back to something closer to the original straight lines of the Annex clip keyhole, as I chase the best printability.
